# The Travelling Grocer
### Running late? Can't find the right aisles? Optimize your shopping route through the store.

-------------------------------

## Description
Time is a resource we all fall short of. Picking up groceries can be time intensive, and sometimes even anxiety-inducing trying to find out where everything is! Our goal with The Travelling Grocer is to make grocery shopping more accessible for people short on time or too socially anxious to ask for help.

Users simply search for all the items on their shopping list, and our web app’s algorithm finds and displays an efficient route through a given grocery store to help users find items as fast as possible. Owners of these grocery stores can also authenticate themselves to access a database where they can edit the inventory at their store.
